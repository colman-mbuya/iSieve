- Finish refactoring and documenting code
- Implement Parse for web services
- Add more vulns!

Optional:
- Password Policy. The code we added for hiding and showing passwords seems to have this functionality. Have a look there and in the repo:

	-- edit: turns out the password length check it does, is just to highlight once a user has entered a password with chars > 7. Once this is done it shows a tick next to the eye icons
